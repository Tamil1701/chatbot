# chatbot
A simple json file based chatbot for simple direct questions.

The project demonstrates a simple implementation of a chatbot using predefined responses stored in a JSON file. It utilizes principles of matching user input, scoring system, and providing appropriate bot responses. Let's delve into a summary of the key concepts and principles employed in the code:

Loading JSON Data:
The code includes a function called load_json that loads the chatbot responses from a JSON file. This allows the chatbot to access the predefined user inputs, corresponding bot responses, and required words for each response.

Matching User Input:
The get_response function processes the user input by splitting it into individual words and converting them to lowercase. It then compares the user input with the predefined user inputs in the JSON data, assigning a score to each response based on the number of matching words and the fulfillment of required words.

Scoring System:
Each response is assigned a score based on the number of matching words and the fulfillment of required words. The code determines the best response by selecting the one with the highest score among all the responses.

Providing Bot Response:
Once the best response is determined, the code retrieves the corresponding bot response from the JSON data. If there is no suitable response (all scores are zero), it falls back to a random response generated by an external module called random_responses.

User Interaction:
The code allows for a simple user interaction loop where the user can input their query, and the chatbot responds accordingly. It utilizes the get_response function to determine the appropriate bot response based on the user's input.
